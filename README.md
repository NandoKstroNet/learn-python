This is a documentation of me learning python from basic to advanced.

## Beginner Level Python
Learning Python 3 in beginner level. You can find this course [here](https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Python-3-Essential-Training/62226-2.html). It's a bit outdated but this was the only available pack I could download at that time. I enjoyed this course and learned a lot about python.
