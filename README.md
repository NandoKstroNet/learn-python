## Intro
Hi, if you're still learning python like me then this is the repository for you! I'll share and document my steps in learning python so you can use it as a guide.

## Mindmap / Roadmap
Here's a mindmap I made and this is the topics I will be learning to get a good grasp of python and be awesome at it. You can view it [here](https://coggle.it/diagram/Wk6pMRImdAABAXL9/t/-) too.

## Preparation
Before you start learning python, I recommend you to create a repository so you can put all the scripts you made for later use. It'll make your github profile look good too. 

## Basics
We'll learn all the basics of python by watching free courses on youtube. I recommend watching this youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwjAHQERL08&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvTn3cK5e6LjhgGiSeVlIRwt) by Derek Banas. It covers most of the basic tutorial. There are assignments he will be asking you to do so don't forget to put all your scripts to your repository. 

The course has 26 episodes. I watched 6 episodes a day.

Follow him for more content and awesome tutorial.
