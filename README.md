### Preparation
Before you start learning python, I recommend you to create a repository so you can put all the scripts you made for later use. It'll make your github profile look good too. 

### Basics
We'll learn all the basics of python by watching free courses on youtube. I recommend watching this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwjAHQERL08&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvTn3cK5e6LjhgGiSeVlIRwt) on Youtube by Derek Banas. It covers most of the basic topics in python. There are assignments he will be asking you to do so don't forget to put all your scripts to your repository. The course has 26 episodes.

- [ ] Watch all videos.
